# Asteroid alert ☄️
Look what **asteroids** are going to make a close approach by Earth today. 

## About 🪨
The app retrieves data from [NASA's NeoWs API](https://api.nasa.gov) and displays it in an easy-to-read format. <br>
It shows important information about each asteroid such as its size, speed, and miss-distance from Earth. It also compares the size of the asteroid to objects such as an Aeroplane or the Eiffel Tower to provide a perspective on how big the asteroid is. 
> ⚠️ The data provided by NASA's API is the most recent and not real-time. 

## Tech 🧑‍💻
App is built in Vanilla JS and uses [spaceKit](https://github.com/typpo/spacekit) library to create the 3D interactive space visualizations.
